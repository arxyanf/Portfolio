🚀 Aryan Vaishnav – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio repository! This project represents my journey as a developer with a strong focus on ☁️ Cloud, ⚙️ DevOps, and 🧠 backend engineering, combined with a modern, interactive frontend experience.

This portfolio is built to be fast, clean, and visually engaging. It showcases my skills, experience, and projects through smooth animations, scroll-based interactions, and a cinematic UI that reflects how I think about engineering — scalable, structured, and intentional. The goal is not just to show *what* I’ve built, but *how* I approach building things.

The application is built using ⚛️ React with ⚡ Vite for blazing-fast development and builds, styled entirely with 🎨 Tailwind CSS. It uses modern UI patterns, subtle 3D depth, and motion to create a polished yet professional look that works across devices 📱💻.

To run this project locally on your machine, clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/arxyanf/Portfolio.git  
cd Portfolio

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 🚀

For production, the portfolio uses Vite’s optimized build system and is deployed using GitHub Pages 📦. Deployment is handled via the gh-pages package. To deploy manually, run:

npm run build  
npm run deploy

This generates a production build and publishes it to the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages serves publicly.

The codebase is structured with reusable React components, data-driven sections, and a clean folder layout to keep things maintainable and scalable. Styling is done purely with Tailwind CSS utilities, and animations are implemented using modern React-friendly animation libraries for smooth and performant motion ✨.

🛠️ Technologies used in this project include React (TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui components, Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. The project is developed on Linux 🐧 and follows standard frontend and tooling best practices.

👨‍💻 About Me  
I am a developer passionate about cloud infrastructure, DevOps practices, and backend systems. I enjoy working with Linux, Python, FastAPI, Flask, AWS, containers, automation, and CI/CD pipelines. I like building systems that are reliable, scalable, and boring in production (the good kind 😄).

# Aryan Vaishnav – Developer Portfolio

This repository contains my personal developer portfolio, built to showcase my skills, experience, and projects with a focus on cloud infrastructure, DevOps practices, and backend development. The portfolio is designed to be modern, performant, and visually engaging while maintaining a clean and professional engineering standard.

The application is built using React with Vite for fast builds and Tailwind CSS for styling. It includes smooth animations, scroll-based interactions, and a modular component structure. The goal of this portfolio is not only to present my work but also to demonstrate how I approach frontend architecture, tooling, and deployment workflows.

The portfolio is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be accessed at:
https://arxyanf.github.io/Portfolio/

To run this project locally, first clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/arxyanf/Portfolio.git  
cd Portfolio

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

For production, the project is built using Vite’s build pipeline. Deployment to GitHub Pages is handled via the gh-pages package. To deploy manually, run:

npm run build  
npm run deploy

This generates an optimized production build and publishes it to the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages serves.

The project uses a structured layout with reusable React components and data-driven sections. Styling is handled entirely through Tailwind CSS, and animations are implemented using modern React-friendly animation techniques. The codebase is organized to remain readable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

Technologies used in this project include React (with TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui components, Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. The development environment is based on Linux, and the project follows standard frontend best practices.

I am a developer with a strong interest in cloud engineering, DevOps, and backend systems. My experience includes working with Linux, Python, FastAPI, Flask, AWS, containerization, and CI/CD concepts. This portfolio reflects both my technical background and my attention to detail in design and user experience.

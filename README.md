 To run this project locally on your machine, clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/arxyanf/Portfolio.git  
cd Portfolio

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 🚀

For production, the portfolio uses Vite’s optimized build system and is deployed using GitHub Pages 📦. Deployment is handled via the gh-pages package. To deploy manually, run:

npm run build  
npm run deploy

This generates a production build and publishes it to the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages serves publicly.

The codebase is structured with reusable React components, data-driven sections, and a clean folder layout to keep things maintainable and scalable. Styling is done purely with Tailwind CSS utilities, and animations are implemented using modern React-friendly animation libraries for smooth and performant motion ✨.

🛠️ Technologies used in this project include React (TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui components, Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. The project is developed on Linux 🐧 and follows standard frontend and tooling best practices.

👨‍💻 About Me  
I am a developer passionate about cloud infrastructure, DevOps practices, and backend systems. I enjoy working with Linux, Python, FastAPI, Flask, AWS, containers, automation, and CI/CD pipelines. I like building systems that are reliable, scalable, and boring in production (the good kind 😄).
